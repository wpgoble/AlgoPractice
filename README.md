# AlgoPractice
This will be a repo so I can practice implementing some common algorithms in various languages.
 I plan to start with C and then move to maybe Python and Java eventually

## Top Algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quicksort
- Binary Sort
- BFS
- DFS
- Lee's Algorithm
- Shortest path in a maze
- Flood fill Algorithm
- Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm
- Kadane's Algorithm
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
- Tree Traversals
- Heap Sort
- Topological Sorting in a DAG
- Disjoint-set Data Structure (Union-Find Algorithm)
- Kruskal's Algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Tree
- Single-Source Shorests Paths - Dijkstra's Algorithm
- All-Pairs Shortests Paths-Floyd Warshall Algorithm
