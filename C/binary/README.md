Binary Search is a divide and conquer algorithm. Like all divide 
and conquer algorithms, Binary Search first divides a large array 
into two smaller sub-arrays and then recursively operate the 
sub-arrays. Instead of operating on both sub-arrays, it discards 
one sub-array and continues on to the second sub-array.
